# Object Detection with Pointing Gestures
 This project has effectively demonstrated how the integration of human pointing gestures with traditional object detection systems can significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of these systems. Our innovative approach not only optimizes computational resources by focusing on user- indicated areas but also enriches the systemâ€™s contextual awareness, thereby facilitating more relevant and precise detections. This integration represents a significant advancement in the field of computer vision, suggesting substantial potential for further developments in interactive systems where human input can directly influence and improve machine perception and decision-making. The successful outcomes from this project lay a strong foundation for future research into creating more adaptive, intuitive, and user-focused detection systems
